# PERCENT STATS
# ==============================
# MMOItems stats listed here store values as whole percentages in YAML
# (e.g. 25 means 25%). The converter will divide these by 100 to produce
# decimal values (e.g. 0.25) for MythicMobs output.
#
# This applies to both attribute-mappings and stat-mappings keys.
# Only list the MMOItems key names (lowercase, hyphenated).
